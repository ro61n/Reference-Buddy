# ReferenceBuddy
A few pages froma a website I made for high school and university students that created a reference (bibliography) list for their assignments.

The server-side code was written in PHP. The website allowed students to create and manage multiple reference lists for their projects. The URL that was used to access the website was: www.referencebuddy.co.za

The Instagram page used to market Reference Buddy still exists: https://www.instagram.com/referencebuddy.co.za/
